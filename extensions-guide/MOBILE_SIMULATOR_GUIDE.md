# 📱 Mobile Simulator: Pro-Grade Responsive Testing

## 🌟 Overview
**Mobile Simulator** goes far beyond simple browser resizing. It allows you to visualize your web applications inside realistic smartphone and tablet frames. This extension doesn't just mimic the resolution; it simulates the **User Agent**, **Pixel Density (Retina)**, and **Touch Events** of specific devices.

## 🚀 Why It Beats "Inspect Element"

### 1. Realistic Device Frames
Unlike the generic responsive mode in Chrome DevTools, this tool places your site inside an actual device body (like an iPhone 15 Pro or Samsung S24). This is perfect for client presentations or high-quality portfolio screenshots.

### 2. True Touch Simulation
Many web interactions (like swiping sliders or hover-effects) behave differently on touch screens. This simulator accurately recreates finger-on-screen behavior to ensure your UX is thumb-friendly.

### 3. Orientation & Tilt
Instantly toggle between **Portrait** and **Landscape** modes with one click to ensure your CSS media queries and layouts are stable during device rotation.
