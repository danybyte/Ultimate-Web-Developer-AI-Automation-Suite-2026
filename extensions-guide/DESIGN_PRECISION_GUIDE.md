## 🌟 Overview

## 🚀 Tool 1: Color Picker (Eyedropper)

### Why it’s Essential:
Instead of inspecting the CSS to find a `background-color` or `border-color`, you can grab any color from any pixel—including colors inside images or gradients.

### Key Features:
* **HEX/RGB/HSL:** Get the color code in the format you need.
* **Color History:** Remembers the last colors you picked for quick access.
* **Palette Generator:** Automatically suggests a palette based on your picked colors.

## 📏 Tool 2: Page Ruler Redux

### Why it’s Essential:
How much padding is *actually* between that button and the text? The Page Ruler allows you to draw a box around any element to see its exact dimensions and relative position.

### Key Features:
* **Width & Height:** Measured in pixels (px).
* **Positioning:** See the exact `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` coordinates.
* **Element Mode:** Automatically snaps the ruler to the boundaries of HTML elements as you hover.
