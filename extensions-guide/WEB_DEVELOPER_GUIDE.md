# 🛠️ Web Developer Toolbar: The Swiss Army Knife for Devs

## 🌟 Overview
The **Web Developer** extension adds a comprehensive toolbar to your browser, providing a massive array of tools to manipulate, inspect, and troubleshoot HTML, CSS, and Images in real-time. It’s an essential companion to the built-in DevTools.

## 🚀 Why This Tool is Essential

### 1. Instant CSS Manipulation
Instead of digging through styles, you can disable all CSS with one click to see the document's semantic structure, or disable only external/inline styles to isolate bugs.

### 2. Image Inspection & Audit
Instantly find broken images, display `alt` attributes on the fly, or see all image paths in a single list. This is a lifesaver for accessibility (A11y) audits.

### 3. Form Debugging
Ever had a disabled button or a hidden input that you needed to test? This tool allows you to instantly enable all form fields, convert `POST` to `GET`, and view full form details without looking at the code.

## 🔍 Top Features You'll Actually Use

| Feature Category | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Outline** | Draw boxes around all `<div>` tags, Headings, or Table cells to see the layout grid. |
| **Resize** | View the page in exact dimensions (800x600, 1024x768) to check legacy support. |
| **Information** | Display ID & Class details directly on the elements as you scroll. |

## 💡 Pro Workflow: The "Clean-Room" Test

1. **JavaScript Check:** Use the "Disable JavaScript" feature to see if your site is still functional or if it shows a proper "No-JS" message.
2. **Semantic Audit:** Disable all styles. If your page looks like a mess, your HTML structure (SEO-wise) needs work.
3. **Broken Image Hunter:** Use the "Find Broken Images" tool after a deployment to ensure all assets are loading correctly on production.

## 🛠 Pro Tip
When using **Playwriter** to write automation scripts, use the **Web Developer Toolbar** to "Outline" elements. It helps you visually identify the `id` and `class` selectors you need to give to your AI agent.
