# 🐞 Usersnap: Visual Feedback & Bug Reporting

## 🌟 Overview
**Usersnap** is the go-to extension for capturing visual feedback and reporting bugs without the back-and-forth emails. It allows you to take a screenshot of any web page, annotate it with drawings or comments, and send it directly to your project management tool (like Jira, Trello, or Slack) with all the technical metadata included.

## 🚀 Why It’s a Workflow Accelerator

### 1. Visual Clarity
Instead of writing: *"The button on the bottom right is slightly misaligned on small screens,"* you simply draw a red circle around it. A picture is worth a thousand lines of bug descriptions.

### 2. Automatic Metadata Collection
When you submit a report, Usersnap automatically attaches:
* **Browser Version** (e.g., Chrome 133)
* **Operating System** (e.g., Windows 11 / macOS)
* **Screen Resolution**
* **URL** where the bug occurred

### 3. In-Browser Annotation
You don't need to save a screenshot, open Photoshop/Paint, edit it, and then re-upload. You do everything—cropping, drawing, and commenting—directly inside the browser tab.

## 💡 How to Use for Quality Assurance (QA)

1. **The Client Loop:** Give your client the Usersnap extension to let them point out changes they want. You'll receive a clear image instead of a vague phone call.
2. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Use Usersnap along with **Mobile Simulator**. Catch a bug on a simulated iPhone, snap it with Usersnap, and send it to the fix-it list.
3. **Internal Peer Review:** Before merging a Pull Request, use Usersnap to highlight any UI "nitpicks" for your teammates to polish.

## 🛠 Pro Tip
Combine **Usersnap** with **Web Developer Toolbar**. Use the toolbar to "Outline Blocks" to show the layout structure, then use Usersnap to point out exactly which `div` or container is causing a layout shift.
