# 🔋 OneTab: The Ultimate RAM Saver & Tab Manager

## 🌟 Overview
**OneTab** is a life-saver for developers and researchers who find themselves with 50+ tabs open. With one click, it collapses all your open tabs into a single, organized list. When you need them again, you can restore them individually or all at once.

## 🚀 Why Every "Tab Hoarder" Needs It

### 1. Save 95% Memory (RAM)
Chrome is notorious for consuming RAM. OneTab stops the background processes of your tabs, instantly freeing up memory for your IDE (like VS Code) or other heavy development tools.

### 2. Reduce Visual Clutter
Too many tabs make the browser icons invisible. OneTab gives you a clean slate, allowing you to focus on the task at hand without losing your research.

### 3. Session Management
You can name your tab groups (e.g., "Project X Research" or "Tailwind Documentation") and keep them saved even if you close the browser or restart your computer.

## 💡 How to Use it Like a Pro

1. **The Context Switch:** When switching from "Coding" to "Learning," collapse all your coding tabs into a OneTab group. This clears your mind and your computer's memory.
2. **The Research Export:** After finishing a deep-dive research session, use the "Share as Web Page" feature to save a permanent record of all the links you visited.
3. **Prevent Accidental Loss:** If your browser crashes, OneTab acts as a secondary backup for your open sessions.
