## 🚀 Why It’s a Designer’s Best Friend

### 1. Instant Identification
Just hover over any text, and WhatFont tells you the name of the font. Click on the text, and it gives you a full breakdown of the typography settings.

### 2. Comprehensive Details
It doesn't just give you the name; it provides:
* **Font Family:** (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, Inter)
* **Size & Weight:** (e.g., 16px, Bold 700)
* **Line Height:** Essential for perfect readability.
* **Color:** The exact HEX or RGB code of the text.

### 3. Type Service Detection
It can detect whether the font is being served via **Google Fonts**, **Typekit (Adobe Fonts)**, or if it's a standard local system font.

2. **Inspiration Hunting:** When you land on a beautiful blog or landing page, use WhatFont to steal their typography "recipe."
